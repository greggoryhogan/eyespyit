# Eye Spy It

Eye Spy it (as it stands today) is a game where users upload an image and select something for others to find. When someone finds the "thing" then it's their turn to upload and wait for others to find. The long term plan for the game is to make a daily image upload where users have x attempts to find the "thing" while using hints and/or increasing the difficulty.

Eye Spy It's functionality is all driven by it's WordPress theme, and therefor this repo controls all the functionality to play the game.
